1. List all employees and their corresponding project details.
select * from EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID = p.EMP_ID


2. Retrieve the names of all employees who are involved in a project, along with their project numbers and departments.
select e.EMP_NAME,p.PROJECT_NO,pos.DEPARTMENT from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID = p.EMP_ID 
LEFT JOIN employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID;

3. Show all employees, and if they are assigned to a project, display their project details. If an employee is not assigned to a project, still list their name.
select * from EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID = p.EMP_ID ;

4. Find the position and department for each employee. Include employees who might not have a defined position.
select * from EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID = pos.EMP_ID ;

5. List the names of employees who are 'Developer' and their respective project departments.
select * from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID = pos.EMP_ID 
INNER JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
WHERE pos.POSITION='Developer';

6. Display all project details, and if an employee is associated with that project, show their name. If a project has no associated employee in the PROJECT table, still list the project details.
select e.EMP_NAME,p.PROJECT_NO,p.EMP_ID from EMPLOYEE e
RIGHT JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID;

7. Find the names and salaries of employees who are in the 'Designing' department for a project.
select e.EMP_NAME,e.SALARY,pos.DEPARTMENT from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID
WHERE pos.DEPARTMENT="Designing";

8. List all employee names, their city, their position, and the department they work in for a project. Include all employees, even if they don't have a position or are not on a project.
select e.EMP_NAME,e.CITY,pos.POSITION,pos.DEPARTMENT,p.PROJECT_NO from EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN  employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID
LEFT JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID = p.EMP_ID;

9. Show the names of employees who are either 'CEO' or 'Manager', along with their respective cities.
select e.EMP_NAME,e.CITY,pos.POSITION from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID
WHERE   pos.POSITION IN ("CEO","Manager");

10. Find the employees who are working on a project in the 'Development' department AND have a 'Developer' position.
select p.EMP_ID,p.PROJECT_NO,pos.POSITION ,pos.DEPARTMENT from PROJECT p
INNER JOIN  employee_position pos
ON p.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID
WHERE pos.POSITION = "Developer" and pos.DEPARTMENT="Development";

11. Identify employees who have the same position but are in different departments in the EMPLOYEE_POSITION table. (This might require more data to show meaningful results with self-join, but you can still attempt it conceptually).
select * from employee_position pos1
INNER JOIN employee_position pos2
ON pos1.POSITION = pos2.POSITION
WHERE pos1.DEPARTMENT!=pos2.DEPARTMENT
AND pos1.EMP_ID > pos2.EMP_ID;

12. For each department in the PROJECT table, find the average salary of employees working in that department.
select avg(e.SALARY),p.DEPARTMENT from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
GROUP BY p.DEPARTMENT;

13. List the employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees working in the 'Development' department (across both PROJECT and EMPLOYEE_POSITION if applicable, or just PROJECT for simplicity).
SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY> (select avg(e.SALARY) as avg_salary from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
GROUP BY p.DEPARTMENT
HAVING p.DEPARTMENT="Development");

or

SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY> (select avg(e.SALARY) as avg_salary from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
INNER JOIN employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID = pos.EMP_ID
GROUP BY p.DEPARTMENT
HAVING p.DEPARTMENT="Development");

14. Find the name of the employee who is the 'CEO' and their corresponding project department (if any).
select e.EMP_ID,e.EMP_NAME,pos.POSITION,p.DEPARTMENT from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN  employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID=pos.EMP_ID
INNER JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
WHERE pos.POSITION = 'CEO';

15. Retrieve the names of employees who are assigned to a project and also have a defined position, and ensure that their department in the PROJECT table matches their department in the EMPLOYEE_POSITION table (if both exist for the same employee).
kets from the 
select e.EMP_ID,e.EMP_NAME,p.DEPARTMENT,pos.DEPARTMENT from EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN PROJECT p
ON e.EMP_ID=p.EMP_ID
INNER JOIN employee_position pos
ON e.EMP_ID = pos.EMP_ID
WHERE p.DEPARTMENT = pos.DEPARTMENT;
