Functional depencency
X -> Y

Types:
Trivial functional dependency 
A->B has trivial functional depency if b is subset of A
Ex: {employee_id,employee_name} and employee_id is subset of {employee_id,employee_name}

Non-Trivial functional depencency

Inference rules:(IR)
6 types of inference rules
1.Reflexive rules
if Y is subset of X, then X determines Y, X->Y.
Ex: X={a,b,c,d,e}
    Y={a,b,c}


2.Augmentation rule
It is called as partial dependency, if X->Y then XZ->YZ

3.Transitive rule
if x determines y and y determine z then x can determine z.
X->Y and Y->Z then X->z

4.Union rule
If x determines y and x determines z then it can determine both y and z.
x->y and x->z then x->yz

5.Decomposition rule
It is reversal of union rule.
If x determine y and z then x can determine for y and x can determine z.
if x->yz then x->y and x->z

6.Pseduo transitive rule.
If x can determine y and yz determines w then xz determines W.
if x->y and yz->W then xz->W


Need for normalization:
    To maintain reduncdancy
    maintain anaomaly

Normalization forms
1NF - A table in 1NF if it contains atomic value(each cell only one value).
2NF - A table in 2NF form, first it should be in 1NF form and all non-primary key 
      attributes are fully dependent on primary key.
3NF - A table should be in 3NF and no tansition dependency should exists between them.
4NF or BCNF - In table, no multi value should be there.
5NF  - Table should be in 4NF, and not contains any joint dependency.

QUICK NOTES:
2nf - all columns needs to depend on primary key
3nf - all columns needs to only depend on primary key (other columns should not depending on other columns)
