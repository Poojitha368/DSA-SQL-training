Functional depencency
X -> Y

Types:
Trivial functional dependency 
A->B has trivial functional depency if b is subset of A
Ex: {employee_id,employee_name} and employee_id is subset of {employee_id,employee_name}

Non-Trivial functional depencency



Inference rules:(IR)
6 types of inference rules
1.Reflexive rules
if Y is subset of X, then X determines Y, X->Y.
Ex: X={a,b,c,d,e}
    Y={a,b,c}

2.Augmentation rule
It is called as partial dependency, if X->Y then XZ->YZ

3.Transitive rule
if x determines y and y determine z then x can determine z.
X->Y and Y->Z then X->z

4.Union rule
If x determines y and x determines z then it can determine both y and z.
x->y and x->z then x->yz

5.Decomposition rule
It is reversal of union rule.
If x determine y and z then x can determine for y and x can determine z.
if x->yz then x->y and x->z

6.Pseduo transitive rule.
If x can determine y and yz determines w then xz determines W.
if x->y and yz->W then xz->W
